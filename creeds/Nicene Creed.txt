Below is the Nicene Creed. Almost all Christians follow this Creed. Reformed Churches, Lutheran Churches, Anglican Churches, Methodist Churches, Roman Catholic Churches, and more follow this Creed. The Nicene Creed heavily talks about the Trinity and what each Person in the Godhead does.

We believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of Heaven and Earth,
      and of all things visible and invisible.

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the only-begotten,
      begotten of the Father before all ages.
      Light of Light, true God of true God, begotten not made,
      of one essence with the Father by whom all things were made;
      who for us men and for our salvation, came down from Heaven,
      and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the virgin Mary
      and became man.
And He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate,
      and suffered, and was buried.
      And the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures;
      and ascended into Heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father;
      and He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead;
      whose kingdom shall have no end.

And [we believe] in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life,
      who proceeds from the Father; who with the Father and the Son
      together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets.

In one holy, catholic*, and apostolic church.
I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins.
I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come.
Amen.

* - That is, universal
