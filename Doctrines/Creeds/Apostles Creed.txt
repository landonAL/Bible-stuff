Below is the Apostles' Creed. Many Christians follow this Creed (which is more heavily followed by the Catholic Church, but some other denominations believe it as well). The Apostles' Creed heavily talks about the persons in the Godhead and the things that each Person in the Godhead does.

I believe in God, the Father almighty,
      creator of Heaven and Earth.

I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
      who was conceived by the Holy Spirit
      and born of the virgin Mary.
      He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
      was crucified, died, and was buried;
      he descended to hell.
      The third day he rose again from the dead.
      He ascended to heaven
      and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty.
      From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Spirit,
      the holy catholic* church,
      the communion of saints,
      the forgiveness of sins,
      the resurrection of the body,
      and life everlasting. Amen.
