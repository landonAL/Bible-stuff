Many people believe that the theory of (macro) evolution is compatible with the creation story written in Genesis. However, if evolution is true, many parts of the Bible become illogical and impossible.

1. The genealogies given in the Bible would be destroyed

One example of this is Adam's genealogy from him to Noah's children given in [Genesis 5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%205&version=KJV). If Adam and Eve did not actually exist, none of the people in this, or any of the other genealogies, actually existed. This would corrupt the entire Bible and is obviously not compatible with the Bible's account.

2. Genesis is meant to be understood literally.

One obvious example of this is when Jesus stated in [Mark 10:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%2010%3A6&version=KJV) that "from the beginning of creation" God made humans male and female. The Bible teaches that man was created during the creation process, soon after it began. Furthermore, in [Isaiah 45:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah%2045%3A18&version=KJV), God says that he created the Earth to be inhabited, and not to be empty. However, science claims that the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, and that humans did not appear until about 200,000 years ago. This is another clear inconsistency between science's account and the Bible's account.

3. Evolution is simply contrary to the Bible's account

Evolution claims that `Modern humans originated in Africa within the past 200,000 years and evolved from the now extinctÂ Homo erectus.`<sup>1</sup>, whereas the Bible states in [Genesis 2:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis%202%3A7&version=KJV) that Adam was made from dust, and did not evolve from other creatures. Genesis is very clear that Adam and Eve were fully human from the moment they were created.
