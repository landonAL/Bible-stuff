The KJV Only movement is one that began in the 19th or 20th century, which teaches that the King James Version of the Bible is the only correct English Bible translation. However, there are different levels of KJV Onlyism, and the most extreme form of it can be quite theologically dangerous. The movement is primarily believed by modern Baptists.

### KJV Preferred

This group prefers to use the KJV, perhaps because it is what they have always used, or because it is what their uses. They often consider the KJV to be the most accurate English translation; however, they do not necessarily consider the KJV to be perfect.

### Received Text Preferred

This group believes that the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts underlying the KJV are superior to the Critical Text used by most modern English Bible translations. The texts underlying the KJV are referred to as the Textus Receptus, or the Received Text. People in this group may be willing to use modern translations based on these texts, such as the NKJV and the MEV; however, some assert that these modern translations are influenced from the Critical Text and should therefore not be read.

### Received Text Only

This group believes that the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts underlying the KJV were perfectly preserved by God and that any other manuscripts will be flawed. This group still does not believe that the KJV is a perfect translation of these texts, but they do believe that it is the best translation of them. Some people in this group may be willing to use modern translations from the Received Text.

### KJV Inspiration

This group believes that the KJV was divinely inspired by God, just as the original manuscripts were, and that it is a perfect translation of Gods words. They also believe that since God chose every word of the KJV, any revision of it even into modern words with the same meaning would be a corruption. None of the people in this group would use a translation other than the KJV, regardless of if it is based on the Received Text.

### KJV Neo-Revelation

This group claims the same things as the [[King James Version Only#KJV Inspiration|previous group]], but also claims that God added **new** revelation into the KJV. They also believe that **all** other translations, even into other languages, should be based on the KJV, and even that the KJV corrects the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. This view is often called "Ruckmanism" after Dr. Peter Ruckman, who was the primary advocate of this view.

### Received Text

The Received Text, also known as the Textus Receptus, originated in 1516 with Desiderius Erasmus. Other popular editions are from Stephanus, Beza, the Elzevir house, Colinaeus, Scrivener.

In Erasmus' edition of the Textus Receptus, he primarily used Byzantine manuscripts, along with Miniscule 1 in some verses and the Latin Vulgate in other verses. Erasmus had only around 8 manuscripts to create his Textus Receptus. Furthermore, even though Erasmus had only one manuscript of Revelation when he created theÂ Textus Receptus, F.H.A Scrivener notes that in a few places such as Revelation 1:4 and Revelation 8:13, Erasmus refers to manuscripts which he had seen earlier during his travels.

Also, Scrivener's Textus Receptus was not a normal text, but was created by trying to change the KJV's New Testament back into Greek.
