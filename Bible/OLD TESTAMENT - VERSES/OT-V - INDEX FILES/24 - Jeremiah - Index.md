![[24 - Jeremiah Hope Scriptures]]

## Notes

Highlight the book of Jeremiah in 3 colours:
- one for the Lord pleading with the people to turn back to Him
- second colour for the people’s response
- third for references to days to come; to us
A fourth colour could be for things the Lord says to Jeremiah

Don’t put my expectations on what the Lord says. Let Him declare what His prophecies mean. Everything God prophesies comes to pass in His timing; in His way.
