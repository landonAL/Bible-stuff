## Notes

![[1 Kings 12.28]]

- Jeroboam told the people it was too much for them to go up to Jerusalem to the temple (after the kingdom split, over taxes, of all things!), so he made them new temples and gods to worship. Keep 'em close to home, stop them defecting to the other kingdom.
	- What is my attitude toward the effort it takes to worship the Lord? Is the Lord worth the journey?


[[1 Kings 17.9]] 
- People are put in place by the Lord to help others. When I'm prompted to help someone, it may be that He is putting me in place in like manner.
- At what point did the Lord command this woman? How did He communicate to her? Did she carefully ration her supplies, watching for the prophet to come? Did the command come to her heart the moment the prophet appeared?

[[1 Kings 17.18]] 
- Miracles can quickly be forgotten in times of trial. The widow had seen her food extended, but in her grief, forgot to trust the Lord when her son died. Did my son die because of my sins, she asks?—The Lord could answer, No, but My Son will die for your sins.

[[1 Kings 19.4]] 
- The Lord is aware of our juniper tree moments. When we have done all we can, and it doesn't seem to be enough. It was time for a nap, and to have angel cake! Recognise the hard times. It's not always time for a pep talk.

[[1 Kings 19.11]]-[[1 Kings 19.12]] 
- And after the fire, a still, small voice.

Elijah felt alone - the Lord gave him a friend!
