## Notes

Esther is the only book of the Bible that doesn't mention God; not even once. But He is there. Look for Him!

Each of us will have a moment where we have the opportunity to rise up, and fulfill the thing we are here for. To use the talents and characteristics we possess, to do what we are uniquely placed to do.

How do I live in a world where my faith is threatened?

Through the view of our culture, what Vashti was asked to do was demeaning, and something she was right to refuse. Fancy being paraded in front of a crowd of drunken, entitled men! But in the context of the culture of the day, what she did was unacceptable. Women were required to be submissive.

Vashti stood up against what she believed was wrong, regardless of the consequences.
