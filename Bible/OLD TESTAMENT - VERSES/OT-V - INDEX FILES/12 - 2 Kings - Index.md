![[12 - 2 Kings Hope Scriptures]]

## Notes
### [[2 Kings 02]]
How did they know he was to be taken up? From the information given I assume the date was revealed to Elijah by the Lord, and that he, Elijah, declared it to the people. For what purpose? To glorify the name of the Lord, and convince the people of His power.

### [[2 Kings 04]]
There was a [[2 Kings 4.8|great woman]] in this place. What made her great? Was it things she had done previous to offering hospitality to a prophet of God, or was that act alone enough for the scriptural designation? 
>![[2 Kings 4.10]]

### [[2 Kings 17]]
This chapter is a good example as what it looks like to ripen in iniquity.

### [[2 Kings 19]]
v14 - In a day of trouble, [[Hezekiah]] went to the House of the Lord and spread that troubling, overwhelming letter before the Lord.
Whatever your problem is, bring it before the Lord.

### [[2 Kings 20]]
[[2 Kings 20-19|v19]] [[Hezekiah]] is the ultimate optimist, it seems.
He foolishly showed his wealth to the Babylon scouts, causing Isaiah to prophesy that he would lose it all, yet he counted it as good!
